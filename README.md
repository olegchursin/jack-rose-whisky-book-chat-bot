# Jack Rose Dining Saloon Whisk(e)y Book Chat Bot

This is a chat bot that can answer questions about the whisk(e)y collection of Jack Rose Dining Saloon, a famous bar in Washington, DC. The chat bot is powered by [Chatbase](^1^), a free platform for building and deploying conversational agents. The chat bot uses the [chatgpt-3.5-turbo](^2^) model, a pre-trained language model based on GPT-3 that can generate natural and engaging responses. The data for training the chat bot was obtained from the [Whisk(e)y Book](^3^) of Jack Rose Dining Saloon, which contains information about more than 2,700 whiskies from around the world.

## Example questions and answers

Here are some example questions and answers that the chat bot can provide:

- Q: What is the oldest whiskey in your collection?
- A: The oldest whiskey in our collection is the Glenlivet 70 Year Old, distilled in 1940 and bottled in 2011. It is a rare and exquisite single malt Scotch whisky that has a rich and complex flavor profile.

- Q: What is the difference between bourbon and rye whiskey?
- A: Bourbon and rye whiskey are both types of American whiskey that are made from fermented grain mash and aged in charred oak barrels. The main difference is that bourbon must be made from at least 51% corn, while rye whiskey must be made from at least 51% rye. Bourbon tends to have a sweeter and smoother taste, while rye whiskey tends to have a spicier and drier taste.

- Q: Do you have any Japanese whiskies?
- A: Yes, we have a great selection of Japanese whiskies, such as Yamazaki, Hakushu, Hibiki, Nikka, and Suntory. Japanese whiskies are known for their delicate and refined flavors, influenced by the craftsmanship and culture of Japan.
